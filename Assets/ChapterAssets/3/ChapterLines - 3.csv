IGUANA,"Lana Iguana is my name sir, indeed,"
IGUANA,"I'm a lazy, thoughtful lizard who has great speed."
IGUANA,"I lounge on that log, just across the way,"
IGUANA,I soak up the sun's rays all day.
IGUANA,"It is a wonderful life I have lived so far,"
IGUANA,Lounging in peaceful nature and a view of the stars.
PIRANHA,"Yes, it is great here in the wild,"
PIRANHA,"For, I lived in the city of Paris as a child."
PIRANHA,"I was brought here from the city, so I never fit in."
PIRANHA,Everybody treats me as if I committed a mortal sin.
PIRANHA,"So, I gave up trying to be friendly and happy,"
PIRANHA,"But I get so lonely, I'm sorry if I'm coming off sappy."
PIRANHA,"Lately, I have been feeling so blue,"
PIRANHA,I'm grateful to be able to talk to you.
IGUANA,"Don't worry Pepe, we'll turn your popularity around,"
IGUANA,"When we're finished, your reputation will rebound."
IGUANA,"You see, because I lay on that log all day,"
IGUANA,Every animal eventually crosses my way.
IGUANA,"I'll vouch for you, I'll say you're truly, really cool."
IGUANA,The other animals will believe me; not one is a fool.
IGUANA,"Tomorrow morning, come right out to my log,"
IGUANA,It is the one that pokes through the bog.
IGUANA,"Come in the morning, and don't be late."
IGUANA,"I'll introduce you to the animals, we'll start with Kate!"
