DRAGON,"His sad cries filled the jungle's night sky,"
DRAGON,There was loneliness echoed in his desperate cry.
DRAGON,"The callings of the giant, meat-eating piranha,"
DRAGON,"Scared every animal, except a mellow iguana."
DRAGON,"The large, leisurely lizard called back to the fish:"
IGUANA,I would love to talk as long as you wish.
IGUANA,"But, you have a look about you and need to earn my trust,"
IGUANA,"Let's start with a conversation, this requirement is a must."
PIRANHA,"I promise to stay in these warm waters,"
PIRANHA,"I just want a friend, I won't bring you bother."
PIRANHA,"My name is Pepe the Piranha,"
PIRANHA,And what is your name Madame Iguana?
DRAGON,"The iguana streaked out her slithery tongue,"
DRAGON,She couldn't believe how the fish had begun.
DRAGON,"The iguana thought, I've never met a French fish,"
DRAGON,"Smiling to herself, she thought 'oh how delish.'"
